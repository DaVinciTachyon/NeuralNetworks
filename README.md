# Neural Networks
I am learning about neural networks.
I built a convolutional neural network where the number of layers and nodes per layer is set at the start, but can be different each time.
I used the neural network in order to learn and test itself using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 28x28 pixel images of white handwritten numbers on a black background
